<p>The homepage is the most important page on most websites, and gets more page views than any other page.
Of course, users don't always enter a website from the homepage.
A website is like a house in which every window is also a door 
People can follow links from search engines and other websites that reach deep inside your site.
However, one of the first things these users do after arriving at a new site is go to the homepage.</p>
